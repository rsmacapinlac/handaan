# mise tool ownership

This repository follows the same boundary as Omarchy: native package managers
own the operating system, desktop applications, services, and shared libraries;
mise owns portable user-facing development tools.

## Lazy tools

`bin/handaan-mise-tools` creates launchers in `~/.local/bin` for:

- `claude`
- `codex`
- `gh`
- `pi`

The optional Arch `security` application group also asks the same script to
create `bw`. Its Mise package is `npm:@bitwarden/cli`, so the CLI and its runtime
remain user-owned without a system-wide `sudo npm install`.

Each launcher asks mise for the current global version on first use, then runs
the tool through `mise x`. `MISE_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=0` is intentional: invoking
a lazy tool or running maintenance is an explicit request for the current
release rather than mise's normal release cooldown.

The launchers are generated rather than tracked as four copies so their behavior
stays identical. `~/.local/bin` precedes legacy npm and AUR locations
in `PATH`, allowing existing machines to migrate without automatically deleting
their previous installations. Those old packages may be removed manually after
the mise-backed commands have been verified.

## Setup and maintenance

- Arch installs mise with pacman/yay.
- Debian LXC installs mise with the official installer into `~/.local/bin`.
- Setup generates the launchers but does not download the four tools.
- Maintenance regenerates the launchers and runs
  `MISE_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE=0 mise up`.

Do not track `config/mise/config.toml` in this repo. rcm maps `config/` onto
`~/.config/`, and the lazy launchers run `mise use --global`, which writes to
that file — tracking it would mean every first run of a launcher dirties the
working tree. mise's own config stays untracked and is configured imperatively
from the setup scripts.

## Other mise candidates

Good next candidates are tools currently installed differently on each platform
or maintained with custom download code:

- Language runtimes, including Ruby and user-facing Python versions.
  This could replace NodeSource, but the OS Python should remain native for
  system scripts and packaged Python modules. Arch installs Node.js and Go only
  through the optional `development` application group.
- `agent-browser`: currently an npm global and a natural lazy npm-backed tool.
- `lazygit`: native on Arch but downloaded and updated manually on LXC.
- Neovim: native on Arch but built from source on LXC. Moving it needs a
  deliberate decision about whether an editor is a bootstrap dependency.
- Release-installed CLIs such as `himalaya`, `gogcli`, and `fastfetch`
  where mise's `aqua`, `ubi`, or GitHub backends can remove custom updater code.

Keep system packages native when they provide libraries, services, hardware or
desktop integration, or are needed before user dotfiles are available. That
includes shells, tmux, GnuPG/pass, audio/video packages, Hyprland components,
mail transport, MPD, printer support, and Python modules consumed by the system
interpreter. Application-owned plugin managers (TPM, lazy.nvim, Pi packages,
and Oh My Zsh) should also remain responsible for their own plugins.

Language runtimes are not installed globally by the core Arch bootstrap. Add a
runtime deliberately through Mise or the optional development group when a
project requires it.
