-- the machine runs clamshell, and re-enables it with `hyprctl reload`, which

-- position and scale are written down.

-- The lid binds in conf/binds.lua cover the lid moving, but pulling the dock

-- disabled there would leave the session with no display at all. These hooks
-- are what bring it back.
