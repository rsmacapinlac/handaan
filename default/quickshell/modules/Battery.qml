// Battery.
//
// Two questions, per docs/quickshell-widgets.md:
//   1. Do I need to plug in?
//   2. Am I gaining charge, holding, or running down?
//
// One channel per question, so neither answer has to be read out of the
// other. Fill length and colour answer the first; the glyph answers the
// second, and sits outside the battery body so it never competes with the
// colour that carries severity.
//
// The second question used to be "am I on mains", answered by the presence of
// a bolt. That conflated two situations worth telling apart: a charger that
// is filling the battery, and one that is connected but delivering nothing.
// The second is common -- an underpowered supply, a cable that negotiated a
// low USB-C contract, a threshold, a firmware inhibit -- and it looks exactly
// like charging if the only signal is "something is plugged in", while the
// battery quietly drains. So the glyph now distinguishes them: a green bolt
// means gaining, a muted plug means connected but static. The widget does not
// try to say *which* cause; from here they are indistinguishable, and the
// glyph reports what is observable.
//
// There is no numeral. The percentage was the obvious thing to draw and it is
// the thing this widget deliberately does not: fill length and the colour
// ladder already answer "do I need to plug in", and a digit sitting next to
// them is a fourth thing to parse that changes no decision the shape did not
// already prompt. Losing it also bought the width the body now spends on fill
// range, which is what makes the shape answer legible in the first place.
// The number lives on hover instead, where the doc says it belongs: detail on
// request, never the answer itself. Nothing below the pointer is required to
// read the widget -- the tooltip only ever restates, more precisely, what the
// shape already said.
//
// Nothing is clickable. There is no obvious action for "the battery is at
// 40%", and the doc's rule is that a widget without one does not need a click
// handler. Power actions live behind the keyboard, not in the bar.
//
// The service connects lazily: UPower's fields read empty until a QML binding
// reads them, because the read is what opens the D-Bus connection. Everything
// below is a declarative binding for that reason -- a one-shot read in
// Component.onCompleted would see zeroes and latch there.
